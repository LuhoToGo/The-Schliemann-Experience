# The-Schliemann-Experience

Story arc: <br>
[Player] acts as an assistant to infamous businessman and archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann
at two of his most famous excavations; Troy (1870-1873) and Mycenae (1874-1876) 
By clicking on objects in the scene, [Player] learns about some of the less that ideal practices 
he engaged in at these sites including but not limited to theft, destruction, forgery, and false documentation. 
[Player] is given 4 or 5 scenarios, all genuine things done by Schliemann at  each site 
[Player] ‘wins’/completes the game by selecting choice Schliemann would have made at the time. 
The game utilises irony in attempt to educate the [Player] on best practice, as one will also be 
offered a current and far more ethical and appropriate option similar to current day practices. 

What do we learn? <br>
The basics of archaeological practice, in an ironic fashion by reviewing ‘bad archaeological’ practice 
(i.e. excavate carefully using a trowel vs dynamite) 
A history of and reflection on previous archaeological  excavation and documentation techniques
<br>
What is the outcome?
